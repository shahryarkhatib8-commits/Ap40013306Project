A comprehensive desktop-based Online Store application built using **Java** and **Swing (GUI)**. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, file management (or data structures), and user interface design.

- **Search & Sort:** Filter products by name or sort them by ID/Price.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add items to the cart, view the total price, and remove items before finalizing.
- **Wallet System:** View current balance and add funds to the wallet.
- **Checkout:** Finalize purchases (updates stock and deducts user balance).

### 🛠 Admin Panel
- **Inventory Management:** View all products in the database.
- **Product Operations:**
  - Add new products.
